# To work with Martin* - the Manual
Well. For starters. Martin is a smart guy. He scares you a bit. That makes you feel needed to keep some principal advantages of him. This turned out to NOT be a sush a good idea. Here is my plan for success to work with Martin from frontend to backend. 

1. Develop working prototypes.
2. If using hitgub. Be shure not to put these in the gitignore-file. 
3. Push ALL the files to a branch.
4. Tell Marting witch branch to files are on. Don't just say. "I pushed to hitgub now!" That just sucks.. 
5. Be sure Martin fetched before pulling the changes
6. When the files is on Martins computer. Make sure he gets them from the right subdirectory. 
7. Make sure he put ALL the changes on the developer server before publishing this to the customer. 
8. Evaluate the resulte toghether. 

# SUCCESS! 
Great job! Now you two have a working worky-workflow! 

Now. Make great things toghether. 

Peace out. 

*Note: Martin is just a name for any other developer you ever will work with
